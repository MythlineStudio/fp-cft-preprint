# fp-cft-preprint
FP-CFT (Forge-Pressure / Convergence Field Theory) is an independent theoretical physics preprint proposing a conservative interpretive framework for gravity. It preserves General Relativity in tested regimes while introducing a scalar convergence field as a physical underpinning, with explicit scope limits and falsifiability.
